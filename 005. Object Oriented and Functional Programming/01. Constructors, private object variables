/* Object Oriented Programming concepts 
    
   Constructors for functions: 
      Constructor function (which initializes a specific instance of an object), 
      capital first letters of constructor variable names to signify they are constructors, 
      'this' tells javascript we are talking about this specific object, 
      'new' in front of an object declaration to create an instance of an object,
      constructors with parameters to create unique objects 
          eg: 
            var Car = function(wheels, horsePower, seats) {
              this.wheels = wheels;
              this.horsePower = horsePower;
              this.seats = seats;
            };
           
            
    Private and Public variables within a function:        
       objects have their own attributes, called properties and their own functions, called methods,
       private vs public properties and methods, 
       using 'var' inside a constructor to reference private, and 'this' to reference public
