/* The basics of programming functions as reusible bits of code in Javascript: 

     Creating functions, calling functions, passing parameters into functions, scope/visibility of variables, global vs. local variables, 
     the unintended consequences of not using var to declare variables (automatically making them global), 
     local variable precedence in functions over global variables, returning variables from within functions,
