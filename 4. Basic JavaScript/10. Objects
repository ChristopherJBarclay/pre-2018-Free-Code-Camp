/* The basics of Objects in Javascript:

    Basic object creation:
        var myDog = {
          "name": "Fido",
          "legs": 4,
          "tails": 1,
          "friends": ["man", "mud", "other dogs"]
        };
        
       
   Other concepts:
      . dot operator (when name of variable is known), 
      [] bracket notation (when name of variable has a space in it),
      updating properties of an object      
      
      using variable names with bracket notation to obtain value of the variable of an object:
          var myDog = "Hunter";
          var dogs = {
            Fido: "Mutt",
            Hunter: "Doberman",
            Snoopie: "Beagle"
          }
          var breed = dogs[myDog];
          console.log(breed);// "Doberman"
