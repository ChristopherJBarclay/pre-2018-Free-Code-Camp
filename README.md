#FreeCodeCamp - Front End
This is my code for the Front End Certificate portion of the FreeCodeCamp.org curriculum.

The Free Code Camp Front End Certificate taught me to code front end web design using: HTML and CSS, Responsive Design with Bootstrap, jQuery, basic and intermediate JavaScript, and basic and intermediate JavaScript algorithm scripting.
