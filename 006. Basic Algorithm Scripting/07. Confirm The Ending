// Challenge: use .substring to see if the end of a string is the same as another string

function confirmEnding(str, target) {
  // .substring takes two arguments: first is the index to begin (0 is first index),
  // the second is index to end (not including that number), so end with str.length
  
  return str.substring((str.length-1)-(target.length-1), str.length) === target;
}

//test: 
confirmEnding("He has to give me a new name", "name");
