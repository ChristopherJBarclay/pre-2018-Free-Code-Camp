/* Regular Expressions

Regular Expressions:
  Regular expressions are used to find certain words or patterns inside of strings.
    For example, if we wanted to find the word "the" in the string "The dog chased the cat"
      we could use the following Regular Expression: 
        /the/gi

  Let's break this down a bit:
    / is the start of the regular expression.
    the is the pattern we want to match.
    / is the end of the regular expression.
    g means global, which causes the pattern to return all matches in the string, not just the first one.
    i means that we want to ignore the case (uppercase or lowercase) when searching for the pattern.


Special Selectors:

  Digit selector: \d
    /\d/g       retrieves number characters in a string
  Appending a plus sign (+) after the selector, e.g. /\d+/g, allows this regular expression to match one or more digits.
    /\d+/g      returns the number of digits in a string
    
    
  White Space selector: 
    \s          retrieves whitespace characters from a string
  The whitespace characters are " " (space), \r (the carriage return), \n (newline), \t (tab), and \f (the form feed).
    /\s+/g      retrieves all the white space characters in a string


  Inverting special selectors:
    Use a capital letter to get the opposite of the special selector.
      \s will get whitespace characters and \S will get every character that is not whitespace
        /\S+/g      retrieves all non-whitespace characters in a string.
