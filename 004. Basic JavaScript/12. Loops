/*
    Types of Loops:
           
           While Loops:         while([condition]) {loop execution code}
           
           For Loops:            for ([initialization]; [condition]; [final-expression]) {loop execution code}
                initialization statement
                condition statement
                final expression
                
           Other For Loop Examples:
                counting even or odd numbers only
                counting backwards with -= in the final expression
                iterate through an array
                
                Nesting For Loops to iterate through multi-dimensional arrays.
