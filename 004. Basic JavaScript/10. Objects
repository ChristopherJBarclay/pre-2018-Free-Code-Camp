/* The basics of Objects in Javascript:

    Basic Object creation:
        var myDog = {
          "name": "Fido",
          "legs": 4,
          "tails": 1,
          "friends": ["man", "mud", "other dogs"]
        };
        
    using variable names with bracket notation to obtain value of the variable of an object:
          var myDog = "Hunter";
          var dogs = {
            Fido: "Mutt",
            Hunter: "Doberman",
            Snoopie: "Beagle"
          }
          var breed = dogs[myDog];
          console.log(breed);// "Doberman"
        
  ------------------------------
   Other basic Object concepts:
        . dot operator (when name of variable is known) 
        [] bracket notation (when name of variable has a space in it)
        updating properties of an object.
        adding new properties to objects using .dot operator or []bracket notation.
        delete object.property       to delete a property from an object using delete.
        objects are key/value storage and can be used to "look up" tabular data.
