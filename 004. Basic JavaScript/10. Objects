/* The basics of Objects in Javascript:

    Basic Object creation:
        var myDog = {
          "name": "Fido",
          "legs": 4,
          "tails": 1,
          "friends": ["man", "mud", "other dogs"]
        };
        
    using variable names with bracket notation to obtain value of the variable of an object:
          var myDog = "Hunter";
          var dogs = {
            Fido: "Mutt",
            Hunter: "Doberman",
            Snoopie: "Beagle"
          }
          var breed = dogs[myDog];
          console.log(breed);// "Doberman"
        
  ------------------------------
   Other basic Object concepts:
        . dot operator (when name of variable is known) 
        [] bracket notation (when name of variable has a space in it)
        Updating Properties of an object by assigning new values to object properties.
        Adding New Properties to objects using .dot operator or []bracket notation.
        Objects are Key/Value storage and can be used to "look up" tabular data instead of switch and if/else statements.
        Accessing Sub-Properties of objects accessed by chaining together .dot operator or []braket notation.
        Accessing Nested Arrays inside of an Object which contains nexted objects with their own arrays.
            objectName[arrayNumber].subPropName[sub-arrayNumber]
        
   Basic Functions:     
        delete object.property       to delete a property from an object.
        .hasOwnProperty(propname)       to check if a property of an object exists.   
        
   Structures:     
        Flexible Data Structure == an array that contain complex objects with their own nested arrays inside. 
        
        JSON == JavaScript Object Notation == a text format, which is language independent, and uses conventions that are
            familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages, including: C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, etc.
