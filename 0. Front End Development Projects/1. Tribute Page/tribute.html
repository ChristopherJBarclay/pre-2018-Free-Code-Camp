		<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
			<p>Chuck was the founder, songwriter, lead guitarist, vocalist, and frontman of the metal band known simply as: Death.</p>
			<p>Chuck helped pioneer new vocal techniques, including the "low growl" and "high pitched scream" sounds employed by many death metal bands today. 
		</p>
		<p>Schuldiner's growling vocals and amazing guitar solos, combined with the dark themes and heavy instrumentation of Death, started a new genre of music, later coined "death metal." </p>
			
		<p>Chuck's music lives on in Death's recordings, and through the members of the official Death cover band, Death For All. </p>
